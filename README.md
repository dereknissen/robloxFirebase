# Google Firebase for ROBLOX
##### ROBLOX is an amazing platform for developers create and publish games. With millions of players on the platform, it is vital that the data in your game is reliable. ROBLOX has their own datastore services that developers may use. However, I have found more success in utilizing Google Firebase. Not only can I view/manage their data in real time, it saves time from having to program in-game data management solutions.


##### In this repo, there are two separate files for my demonstration. This architecture was used for a personal project of mine on the ROBLOX platform. The firebaseHandler.lua file is a dependency of playerStats.lua that handles exchanges between my ROBLOX server scripts and the realtime database on Google Firebase.

##### I have worked on small teams where this method of data storage/retrival was scaled to be successful with >100,000 ROBLOX players.
